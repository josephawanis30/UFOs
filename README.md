# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The pupose of this Module is to create a webpage to display UFO sightings, and placing it in a 
table form with filtering by date, city, state, country, and shape. 



## Results: 
Dana would be able to pull UFO sightings from all over, Dana would be able to pull info for her own
curiosity and fun or maybe creating a conspiracy theories.  



## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
The one draw back is you can only pull one city at atime, a little time consuming.  Maybe a more
advanced search bar option would help with more filters and info return.
